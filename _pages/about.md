Hello! I'm **Mikhail Kudinov**, a cryptographer and security researcher with a deep passion for post-quantum cryptography, provable security, and building efficient, real-world cryptographic systems. Currently, I‚Äôm a PhD candidate at **Eindhoven University of Technology**, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Andreas H√ºlsing.

My work sits at the intersection of theory and practice ‚Äî I‚Äôm driven by a desire to make cryptography not just provably secure, but also practical, scalable, and ready for the post-quantum era. Over the years, I‚Äôve collaborated with both academic researchers and industry leaders, including the **Ethereum Foundation**, to help design cryptographic protocols that are resilient to quantum attacks while remaining efficient for deployment.

Before my PhD, I worked at the **Russian Quantum Center**, where I led teams on applied cryptography projects, developed secure communication protocols, and contributed to shaping cryptographic infrastructures for critical systems. I regularly participate in cryptographic competitions and have multiple wins at international contests like **NSUCRYPTO**.

Outside of research, I enjoy solving math puzzles, engaging with the cryptography community through reviews, talks, and collaborations.

## üß† Research & Contributions

Over the last 7+ years, I‚Äôve:

- Published extensively at top-tier venues such as **IEEE S&P** and **ASIACRYPT**.
- Contributed to the **SPHINCS+** signature scheme ‚Äî now standardized by **NIST**.
- Collaborated with the **Ethereum Foundation** on integrating hash-based multi-signatures into post-quantum infrastructure.
- Led research teams at the **Russian Quantum Center**, where we developed practical, quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions for real-world applications.

I‚Äôve also reviewed papers for major conferences including Eurocrypt, SAC, and PKC, and served as a speaker at international workshops on cryptographic security.
