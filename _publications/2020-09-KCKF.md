We construct a new protocol for attribute-based encryption with the use of the modification of the standard secret sharing scheme. In the suggested modification of the secret sharing scheme, only one master key for each user is required that is achieved by linearly enlarging public parameters in the access formula. We then use this scheme for designing an attribute-based encryption protocol related to some access structure in terms of attributes. We demonstrate that the universe of possible attributes does not affect the resulting efficiency of the scheme. The security proofs for both constructions are provided.
