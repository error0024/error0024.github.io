In this work, we discuss in detail a flaw in the original security proof of the WOTS+ variant of the Winternitz one-time signature scheme, which is an important component for various stateless and stateful many-time hash-based digital signature schemes. We update the security proof for the W-OTS+ scheme and derive the corresponding security level. Our result is of importance for the security analysis of hash-based digital signature schemes.
